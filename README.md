# Humble Superhero API
This small API has two endpoints, a get that returns all the heroes saved and a post to add a superhero.
To create the backend I used **NodeJS** with the **express** framework and I did a simple frontend with **React** and **bootstrap** containing a formular and a list to show all the superheroes.

## Expansion posibility
This API is very simple right now, here are things that I would add to make it more complete:
- Add a database like **MySQL**.
- Add the possibility to upload pictures for each superhero, I would do that with the **multer middleware**.

## If I had more time
I would have taken more time to test the humility score with Jest.

## Use this project:

Start the backend:
```
cd SuperheroApiBack
npm i
npm run start
```

start the front:
```
cd SuperheroFront
npm i
npm run dev
```
